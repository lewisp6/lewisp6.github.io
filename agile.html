          As Agile Practice Lead my role focused on training, implementing
          development best practices, improving software development processes
          and developing a strong culture at Kurt Geiger. The role consists of
          many different responsibilities, detailed below is some of what I work
          on on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <h2>Development Practices</h2>
        <h3>Workshops</h3>
        <p>
          Part of the role involved me developing workshops covering development
          practices such as TDD. The training program I put together at KG was made
          up of the following workshop as well as additional smaller ones on
          anything from git usage to pair programming.
        </p>
        <h4>Clean Code</h4>
        <p>
          My aim here was to focus on an emphasis that the most important aspect
          of writing code is communication. Code must be understood easily by other
          developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workshops on clean code cover best practices when writing code. I use
          these sessions to discuss with developers how best we can write code
          that is both readable and maintainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          After establishing a concensus amongst workshop groups on clean code
          techniques workshops move toward implementing these techniques on both
          legacy and new codebases through mob programming sessions. Additional
          support for developers is provided through pair programming sessions with
          me.
        </p>

        <h4>Test Driven Development</h4>
        <p>
          These workshops focused on trying to introduce and maintain a culture
          of test driven development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of test driven development is introduced as are some of
          the testing tools we use. As pairs developers then attempt a series
          of coding exercises where they write the tests first before the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand real world application of TDD we'll go through a feature
          a developer is working on as a mob using the TDD techniques establised
          in earlier workshops.
        </p>


        <h4>End To End Testing</h4>
        <p>Aim was to help establish BDD development techniques and standards around that.</p>

        <p>
          This workshop covers the tools we use for end to end testing and the
          best practices around writing these.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also introduces people to the Gherkin syntax we use to write tests
          in a human readable way and the ideas of Behaviour Driven Development.
          I'll usually involve a non developer team member in this workshop to
          help define the Gherkin steps and then write the tests together.
         </p>
        <h2>Agile Practices</h2>
        <p>
          The other side to my role was a focus on improving the day to day
          agile practices performed by each of the teams. This meant supporting
          each individual team and the team leads in running planning sessions,
          retrospectives and work organisation.
        </p>
        <h3>Retrospectives</h3>
        <p>
          I help facilitate retrospectives with teams running them in different
          formats depending on the situation. Some of the retro formats I run are:
        </p>
        <h4>Start Stop Continue</h4>
        <p>
          A simple retrospective. I'll ask participants to write down on post its
          things they would like their team to start doing, stop doing and
          continue doing over the next two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once everyone has written something down i'll ask each individual to
          share their starts, stops and continues and stick them on the wall.
          After everyone has finished i'll ask participants to group the post its
          then vote on which group they would like to make an action for the next
          two weeks.
        </p>
        <h4>Positivity Retro</h4>
        <p>
          This retro starts with each team member writing down something they
          appreciate about their fellow team members. These are then shared
          to introduce a positive amostphere from the start.
        </p>
        <h4>
        <h3>Culture Change</h3>
        <h4>Onboarding Improvements</h4>
        <p>
          Using Lean UX techniques we've looked into the issues around the
          developer onboarding process at Kurt Geiger. As part of these I've
          conducted research into difficulties developers have faced during the
          onboarding process through interviews and surveys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with a small team we identified problems from the feedback and
          begun working on a small soulution for one of these problems, here the focus
          has been on small and fast iterations of an onboarding platform. Getting
          it into the hands of our users as quickly as possible and iterating on their feedback.
