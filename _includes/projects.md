#### [Yii Calander App](https://github.com/lewisp6/Calendar)
Something I was messing about with just to learn about Yii.

#### [Spaceship Navigator](https://github.com/lewisp6/spaceship-navigator)
An Android game similar to *Habour Master* or *Fligh Control* where you would guide spaceships to planets and avoid collisions. The game is currently unfinished.

#### Masters Dissertation
I worked on a natural language project with the end aim being the clustering of Google Scholar search results by author to improve usefulness.

This was done through a perl script which would parse results and process them through NLP techniques and a clustering algorithm using [Cluto](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/cluto).
